## Introduction
Geography subject is one of the least popular subjects and tend to be overlooked upon by more popular subjects such as math and science. Hence, there are not many platforms for users who are interested in geography. This geography quiz website mitigates the issue by having additional platform for those who are interested in geography, which allows them to test themselves on geography-related questions. This in turn provide these people with an online outlet to improve themselves.

## Design Process
The focus on the website is mainly for students to put improve their knowledge on geography through quiz.
This project provides them with a platform where they can participate in an individual quiz, and at the end, be able to compare themselves to their class.
With that in mind, the design of the project should be kept simple as to not distract the students from answering the quiz.
